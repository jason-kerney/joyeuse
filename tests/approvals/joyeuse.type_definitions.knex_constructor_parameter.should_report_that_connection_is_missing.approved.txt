constuctor was not the correct type

object recieved from constuctor:
{
    "client": "mssql",
    "searchPath": "some,path"
}

Knex is the underlying library. To understand what it is expecting read:
http://knexjs.org/

Below is a list of properties and whether or not they pass validation.

NOTE: If the connection property is listed you should know that the
connection property has 3 different valid variations on what it can be.
only one of those needs to pass validation.

constuctorInfo: false
constuctorInfo.connection{string}:false
constuctorInfo.connection{object}: false
constuctorInfo.connection{object}.host: false
constuctorInfo.connection{object}.user: false
constuctorInfo.connection{object}.socketPath: false
constuctorInfo.connection{object}.password: false
constuctorInfo.connection{object}.database: false
constuctorInfo.connection{path-object}: false
constuctorInfo.connection{path-object}.fileName: false
